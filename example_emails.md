This site appears to be suffering from the introduction of AI search. Organic traffic volumes are gradually dropping per month, even though ranking of keywords hasn’t dropped. However, conversions are remaining fairly flat (on average across the last 12 months). We have seen this on other sites as well, which generally means answers to queries have been provided in the AI overview and no click-thru was carried out. At this point in time, there is no way to track appearances in the overviews or LLM tools to confirm this theory though.

A decision needs to be made about how far off the new site is. We’d like to get approved blog posts live and working for us, but will need to build a blog area on the old site to achieve this. We have expected the new site to go live, so have held off making significant structural updates till now. Can the client give an indication of when that will happen so we can plan around it?
