## **The Simplest Way to Start**

Just use this one-line prompt:

```
Build the Email Reports Automation system following @CLAUDE.md, @DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, and @task_deps.md - Start with Phase 1
```

The orchestrator will handle everything automatically.

## **Recommended: Slightly More Detailed Prompt**

For better context and control:

```
Build the Email Reports Automation system.

Planning docs: @CLAUDE.md, @DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, @task_deps.md
Working directory: c:\Apps\Email Reports
Deployment: Develop on Windows, deploy to Linux server (cPanel)

Start with Phase 1 from @task_deps.md:
- Environment setup
- Project structure
- OAuth configuration
- Initial templates

Guide me through manual steps (OAuth, sample PDFs, client database).
```

## **Even Simpler: Just Say What You Want**

The orchestrator understands natural language:

```
Help me build the email automation system in @CLAUDE.md
```

or

```
I want to implement the SEO/SEM reporting automation - let's start
