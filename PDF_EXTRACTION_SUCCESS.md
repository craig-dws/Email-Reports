## Technical Details

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Field Name Matching**
   - Updated field names to match Looker Studio's exact terminology
   - SEO: "Key events" (not "Conversions"), "Active users", "New users"
   - Google Ads: "Conv. rate" (not "Conversion rate"), "Avg. CPC" (not "Average CPC")

2. **Field Order**
   - Fields are now listed in the exact order they appear in Looker Studio PDFs
   - This ensures correct value-to-metric mapping

3. **Value Extraction Regex**
   - Handles time format: `00:03:29`
   - Handles currency: `$2.96`, `$984`
   - Handles percentages: `5.12%`, `63.31%`
   - Handles regular numbers: `22,837`, `14,350`

4. **Change Percentage Handling**
   - Extracts positive changes: `+11.8%`
   - Extracts negative changes: `-7.6%`
   - Handles N/A values: `N/A`

5. **Best-Match Algorithm**
   - Finds the line with the MOST matching field names
   - Prevents false matches from section headers
   - Google Ads PDF has multiple lines with partial matches - the algorithm now finds the correct one

## KPI Data Structure

The extracted KPIs are returned as a dictionary with this structure:

```python
{
    'Sessions': {
        'value': '22,837',
        'change': '11.8%'
    },
    'Active users': {
        'value': '14,350',
        'change': '14.8%'
    },
    # ... etc
}
```

This makes it easy to display in a 3-column HTML table:

| Metric | Value | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Sessions | 22,837 | +11.8% |

## Next Steps

### ✅ Completed:
1. PDF extraction logic fixed and tested
2. Both SEO and Google Ads formats working
3. All KPIs extracting with values and change percentages
4. Business name, date, and report type detection working

### ⏳ Remaining Tasks:

1. **Update Email Template** - Modify HTML template to display 3-column KPI table
2. **Update .env File** - Add your agency details (you may have already done this)
3. **Test Full Workflow** - Run the complete system end-to-end
4. **Test with All 30 Client PDFs** - Verify extraction works for all reports
