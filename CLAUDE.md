## Internal FAQ (Team & Stakeholder Concerns)

### Migration & Implementation

**Q: Why are we moving away from Relevance AI?**
A: Relevance AI served its purpose but has three critical limitations: (1) ongoing subscription costs that don't align with our usage, (2) inflexible automation requiring manual PDF attachment, and (3) lack of Google Analytics MCP integration for future AI-powered insights. The new system addresses all three issues while providing greater control and customization.

**Q: What's the migration plan?**
A: Phase 1 (MVP) replicates and improves current functionality: PDF extraction, KPI parsing, email generation, and approval workflow. We'll run parallel systems for one reporting cycle to ensure reliability before fully deprecating Relevance AI.

**Q: How long until the system is operational?**
A: No fixed deadline. We're prioritizing quality over speed, with a flexible timeline that allows thorough testing and refinement.

### Technical Architecture & Decisions

**Q: What are the deployment options being considered?**
A: Three primary approaches are under evaluation:
1. **Local Windows Application:** Runs on office workstation, full control, no hosting costs
2. **Cloud-Hosted Solution:** Runs on cloud infrastructure, accessible anywhere, recurring costs
3. **Hybrid Approach:** PDF processing local, email generation cloud-based

The plan-synthesizer will provide detailed pros/cons analysis for each option based on security, cost, reliability, and maintenance requirements.

**Q: How will PDF extraction work?**
A: Currently evaluating two approaches:
1. Continue using Make.com (existing integration, proven reliability)
2. Gmail API direct integration (eliminates third-party dependency, more control)

Decision will be based on complexity, cost, and maintenance overhead.

**Q: What database will store client information?**
A: Options under evaluation: CSV (simple, portable), SQLite (structured, no server), Google Sheets (collaborative, cloud-based). Selection criteria: ease of updates, backup reliability, and deployment environment compatibility.

**Q: How will we handle the approval workflow?**
A: Two approaches being researched:
1. **Email-based review:** Drafts sent to review address, managed via CSV tracking spreadsheet
2. **Preview interface:** Web-based interface showing exact email appearance before approval

If interface approach is chosen, it must render emails identically to how they'll appear when sent.

### Security & Compliance

**Q: How is client data secured?**
A: All API credentials and OAuth tokens stored in .env file (never committed to version control). No sensitive client data is involvedâ€”only business names, contact emails, and service types. PDFs are archived after processing, with copies retained in Google Drive.

**Q: What OAuth scopes are required for Gmail integration?**
A: Minimum required scopes: Gmail API read access (for PDF extraction), Gmail API draft creation, Gmail API send (for future auto-send). All OAuth credentials managed through Google Workspace admin console.

**Q: What happens if credentials are compromised?**
A: Credentials can be revoked and regenerated through Google Workspace console. System uses OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens, allowing credential rotation without system reconfiguration.

### Workflow & Operations

**Q: What's the exact workflow from PDF receipt to sent email?**
A:
1. Looker Studio emails 30 PDFs to business Gmail (batch arrival over few hours, start of month)
2. System extracts PDFs from email (Make.com or Gmail API)
3. PDFs stored temporarily for processing
4. For each PDF:
   - Extract business name from report header
   - Extract date/month for subject line construction
   - Extract KPI table (6 metrics: Sessions, Conversions, Active Users, Engagement Rate, Bounce Rate, Avg Session Duration)
   - Match business name to client database
   - Retrieve: client first name, email, service type (SEO/SEM), predefined personalized text
5. Generate HTML email:
   - Subject: "Your [Month] SEO Report" or "Your [Month] Google Ads Report"
   - Greeting: "Hi [First Name],"
   - Opening: "Please see the data below for [Business Name]."
   - Personalized text (1-2 lines, predefined per client)
   - Standard paragraph about keyword rankings
   - KPI table (HTML formatted for email compatibility)
   - Standard closing paragraph
   - Attach original PDF report
6. Send all draft emails to review address OR present in approval interface
7. User reviews via CSV/spreadsheet tracking (client name, status, notes columns)
8. User marks approved/needs revision in tracking sheet
9. System creates Gmail drafts for all approved emails
10. User manually sends each draft from Gmail, spacing out sends (not all at once)

**Q: How many clients do we process monthly?**
A: 30 clients total: approximately 25 SEO reports and 5 Google Ads reports. All processed as monthly batch, not real-time.

**Q: What happens if a PDF is corrupted or data can't be extracted?**
A: System will flag extraction errors in approval workflow. User can manually review problem PDFs and decide whether to fix source data or manually create email for that client.

**Q: How are emails spaced out to avoid spam flags?**
A: User manually sends from Gmail drafts, naturally spacing sends. Future Phase 2 may introduce auto-send with configurable delays (e.g., 5-10 minutes between sends).

### Cost & Resources

**Q: What's the budget for this project?**
A: Free and open-source tools preferred. Willing to pay small amounts for premium tools if value is clearly justified. Primary cost savings goal: eliminate Relevance AI subscription.

**Q: What ongoing maintenance is required?**
A: User (agency owner) will maintain system themselves. Documentation must focus on "how to use" rather than deep technical architecture. Key maintenance tasks: updating client database, reviewing/approving emails, handling extraction errors.

**Q: What skills are required for maintenance?**
A: User is comfortable with technical setup and following documentation. System should require minimal coding knowledge for routine operations (updating client data, running monthly process, handling common errors).

### Future Roadmap (Phase 2)

**Q: What's planned for Phase 2?**
A:
1. **Google Analytics MCP Integration:** Direct connection to Google Analytics for real-time data access
2. **AI-Generated Insights:** Claude-powered analysis identifying trends, anomalies, and opportunities
3. **Interactive Dashboard:** Web-based approval interface replacing CSV spreadsheet
4. **Auto-Send Capability:** Automated sending with spacing after approval (vs. manual Gmail sending)

**Q: When will Phase 2 features be implemented?**
A: Phase 2 timeline is undefined and depends on Phase 1 success, user feedback, and business priorities. Each Phase 2 feature can be implemented independently.

**Q: Will AI insights replace personalized text?**
A: No. AI insights will augment, not replace, the predefined personalized text. The system will combine human-written custom notes (relationship context, ongoing initiatives) with AI-generated performance analysis (trend identification, anomaly detection, recommendations).

- KPI table styling: borders, padding, alternating row colors (subtle)
- Responsive design for mobile (use `@media` queries)
- Test on Gmail (web, iOS, Android), Outlook (desktop, web), Apple Mail

**Email Template Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Your [Month] [Service Type] Report</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
  <div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px;">
    <p>Hi [First Name],</p>
    <p>Please see the data below for [Business Name].</p>
    <p>[Personalized Text from Database]</p>
    <p>[Standard Paragraph about Keyword Rankings]</p>

    <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
      <thead>
        <tr style="background-color: #f4f4f4;">
          <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px; text-align: left;">Metric</th>
          <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px; text-align: right;">Value</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">Sessions</td>
          <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; text-align: right;">[Sessions Value]</td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Repeat for all 6 KPIs -->

    </table>

    <p>[Standard Closing Paragraph]</p>
    <p>Best regards,<br>[Agency Name]</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Edge Cases:**
- Business name contains special HTML characters (&, <, >) â†’ Properly escape
- Personalized text contains line breaks â†’ Convert to `<br>` tags
- KPI values too long for table cell â†’ Handle text wrapping
- Email client blocks images â†’ No critical images used (text-only design)

**Standard Text Templates (To Be Provided):**
- Standard paragraph about keyword rankings (same for all SEO reports)
- Standard closing paragraph (same for all reports)
- Agency signature block

### Feature 5: Approval Workflow

**User Story:**
As a user, I want to review all generated emails before they're sent so that I can catch any errors, verify personalization, and ensure quality control before client delivery.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System presents all generated emails for review (method TBD: email preview or web interface)
- [ ] For each email, user can see:
  - Client name and business name
  - Full email preview (subject line, body, KPI data)
  - PDF attachment confirmation
  - Any extraction errors or warnings
- [ ] User can mark each email as:
  - **Approved:** Ready for draft creation
  - **Needs Revision:** Requires manual correction
- [ ] User can add notes for emails needing revision
- [ ] System tracks approval status (spreadsheet or database)
- [ ] System only creates Gmail drafts for approved emails
- [ ] System provides summary: X approved, Y need revision, Z total

**Technical Notes:**
- **Option A: Email-Based Review**
  - System sends all draft emails to review address (e.g., owner@agency.com)
  - User reviews in Gmail inbox
  - User updates CSV/Google Sheets with approval status
  - Columns: Client Name | Business Name | Status | Notes | Extraction Errors
  - System reads spreadsheet to determine which to draft

- **Option B: Web Preview Interface**
  - Local or cloud-hosted web app
  - Shows email exactly as it will appear when sent
  - Approve/Reject buttons for each email
  - Notes field for revision comments
  - Must render email identically to final version (critical requirement)

**Decision Criteria:**
- User preference (which workflow is more comfortable?)
- Development complexity (web interface requires more dev time)
- Accuracy of preview (can web interface perfectly replicate email rendering?)

**Edge Cases:**
- All emails approved â†’ Proceed directly to draft creation
- All emails need revision â†’ Provide manual workflow instructions
- User forgets to update approval spreadsheet â†’ System prompts/reminds
- Approval status file corrupted â†’ System creates new blank template

---

### Feature 6: Gmail Draft Creation

**User Story:**
As a user, I want the system to create Gmail drafts for all approved emails so that I can review them one final time in Gmail and send them manually at my preferred pace.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System reads approval status (from spreadsheet or database)
- [ ] System creates Gmail draft for each approved email using Gmail API
- [ ] Each draft includes:
  - To: Client email address
  - Subject: Properly formatted subject line
  - Body: Complete HTML email
  - Attachment: Original PDF report
- [ ] Drafts appear in Gmail "Drafts" folder
- [ ] Drafts are labeled/organized for easy identification (optional: apply Gmail label "Monthly Reports - [Month]")
- [ ] System provides confirmation: "Created X drafts successfully"
- [ ] System logs any draft creation errors

**Technical Notes:**
- Gmail API `users.drafts.create` method
- Required scope: `gmail.compose`
- Draft format: MIME multipart (text/html + PDF attachment)
- Attachment encoding: Base64
- Gmail API quota: 250 units/user/second (30 drafts well within limit)

**Draft Creation Process:**
1. For each approved email:
   - Load HTML email body
   - Load PDF file from processing directory
   - Construct MIME message:
     ```
     Content-Type: multipart/mixed
       - Part 1: text/html (email body)
       - Part 2: application/pdf (PDF attachment)
     ```
   - Base64 encode MIME message
   - Call Gmail API `users.drafts.create`
   - Log success/failure

2. Error handling:
   - Gmail API rate limit exceeded â†’ Implement exponential backoff
   - PDF file not found â†’ Log error, skip draft, notify user
   - Network error â†’ Retry up to 3 times

**Edge Cases:**
- Gmail API authentication expires â†’ Refresh OAuth token automatically
- PDF file too large (Gmail limit: 25MB per message) â†’ Flag oversized PDFs
- Draft creation partially fails (e.g., 28/30 succeed) â†’ Report which failed, allow retry
- Drafts already exist from previous run â†’ Option to replace or skip

---

### Feature 7: Manual Sending with Spacing Guidance

**User Story:**
As a user, I want clear guidance on manually sending Gmail drafts with appropriate spacing so that I avoid spam flags and ensure optimal deliverability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System provides instructions for manual sending process
- [ ] Instructions include recommended spacing (e.g., "Send 5-10 emails per hour")
- [ ] System identifies drafts to be sent (by Gmail label or folder)
- [ ] (Optional) System provides checklist: "Sent [0/30]" for user to track progress
- [ ] Documentation includes best practices for avoiding spam flags

**Technical Notes:**
- This is MVP approach; Phase 2 will introduce auto-send with programmatic spacing
- Manual sending ensures user maintains full control during early deployment
- User can use Gmail's native "Send" button for each draft

**Sending Best Practices (Documentation):**
- Space sends 5-10 minutes apart (not critical, but recommended)
- Send in batches: 10 emails, then 15-minute break, then next 10
- Monitor Gmail's "Sent" folder to confirm successful delivery
- Check for bounce-backs or delivery failures
- Send during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM local time) for better engagement

**Edge Cases:**
- User sends all drafts at once â†’ Not ideal, but won't break system (deliverability risk only)
- User forgets to send some drafts â†’ Drafts remain in Gmail; user can send later
- Sent emails bounce back â†’ User manually follows up with client

---

### Feature 8: Error Handling & Logging

**User Story:**
As a user, I want clear error messages and comprehensive logs so that I can troubleshoot issues independently and understand what happened when something goes wrong.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System logs all major operations: PDF extraction, KPI parsing, database matching, email generation, draft creation
- [ ] Logs include timestamps, operation type, success/failure status, error messages
- [ ] Errors categorized by severity:
  - **Critical:** System cannot proceed (e.g., Gmail API auth failure)
  - **Warning:** Recoverable issue (e.g., single PDF extraction failed)
  - **Info:** Normal operation (e.g., "Processing PDF 5 of 30")
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly, not technical stack traces
- [ ] System creates error summary report: "5 PDFs flagged for manual review: [List of business names]"
- [ ] Logs stored in dated files (e.g., `logs/2025-01-05.log`)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use logging library (Python: `logging`, Node.js: `winston` or `pino`)
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Log rotation: Keep last 12 months of logs (monthly batch = 12 log files/year)
- Log format: `[2025-01-05 14:23:45] [INFO] [PDF_EXTRACTION] Successfully extracted report for ABC Corp`

**Error Scenarios & Messages:**

| Error Scenario | Severity | User-Friendly Message | Troubleshooting Hint |
|----------------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Gmail API auth failure | CRITICAL | "Cannot connect to Gmail. Please check OAuth credentials in .env file." | Verify .env file exists, check token expiration |

## Development Principles & Testing Philosophy

### Core Development Principles

**1. Reliability Over Features**
- The system must work correctly 100% of the time for core functionality (PDF extraction, KPI parsing, email generation)
- Prefer simple, proven solutions over complex, cutting-edge approaches
- Extensive error handling and graceful degradation
- No silent failuresâ€”always log and notify user of issues

**2. User-Centric Design**
- Every feature must reduce user effort, not increase complexity
- Clear, actionable error messages (never expose stack traces to user)
- Workflow should feel intuitive, not require constant documentation reference
- User maintains control (approval step prevents automated mistakes)

**3. Maintainability First**
- Code must be readable and well-documented (inline comments for complex logic)
- Modular architecture: PDF extraction, KPI parsing, email generation, draft creation should be independent components
- Configuration over hardcoding (email templates, database paths, API endpoints in config files)
- User should be able to update templates and database without touching code

**4. Fail-Safe by Default**
- When in doubt, flag for manual review rather than proceeding with uncertain data
- Never send emails automatically without user approval (at least in MVP)
- Database backups before any updates
- Rollback capability if processing fails mid-workflow

**5. Cost-Conscious Architecture**
- Prefer free, open-source libraries with strong community support
- Minimize API calls (batch operations, cache where appropriate)
- Avoid unnecessary cloud infrastructure if local deployment suffices
- Only pay for tools that provide clear, measurable value

### Testing Philosophy

**Unit Testing (Component-Level)**
- Test each component independently:
  - PDF extraction: Test with sample Looker Studio PDFs (SEO and Google Ads variants)
  - KPI parsing: Test with various PDF formats, edge cases (missing metrics, formatting variations)
  - Database matching: Test fuzzy matching with intentional typos, case variations
  - Email generation: Test template rendering with all field combinations
  - Draft creation: Test MIME message construction, attachment encoding

**Integration Testing (Workflow-Level)**
- Test complete end-to-end workflow:
  - Start with 5 test PDFs (3 SEO, 2 Google Ads)
  - Verify all 5 emails generated correctly
  - Verify Gmail drafts created successfully
  - Manually send one test draft, verify receipt and rendering

**User Acceptance Testing (Real-World Validation)**
- First production run: Process all 30 PDFs, user reviews each email manually
- Compare generated emails to manually-created emails (previous months)
- Verify KPI data accuracy by spot-checking against original PDFs (sample 10 reports)
- Send test emails to user's own email addresses across different clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)

**Regression Testing (Ongoing)**
- Maintain test PDF library (representative samples from each month)
- Re-run tests when Looker Studio changes PDF format
- Re-test after any code changes or dependency updates

**Error Simulation Testing**
- Missing PDF attachments in emails
- Corrupted PDF files
- Business names not in database
- Malformed KPI data
- Gmail API authentication failures
- Network interruptions during draft creation

### Quality Assurance Checklist (Before Production Use)

**Data Accuracy:**
- [ ] KPI extraction matches PDF data exactly (100% accuracy on 10 sample PDFs)
- [ ] Business name matching works with intentional typos (< 85% similarity threshold)
- [ ] Personalization data (first name, email, custom text) correctly populated
- [ ] Subject lines accurately reflect month and service type

**Email Rendering:**
- [ ] HTML emails render correctly in Gmail (web, mobile)
- [ ] HTML emails render correctly in Outlook (desktop, web)
- [ ] HTML emails render correctly in Apple Mail (desktop, mobile)
- [ ] KPI tables display properly (borders, alignment, readability)
- [ ] PDF attachments open correctly from received emails

**Workflow Integrity:**
- [ ] All 30 PDFs extracted successfully
- [ ] Approval workflow allows flagging emails for revision
- [ ] Only approved emails generate Gmail drafts
- [ ] Drafts contain correct recipient, subject, body, attachment

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Missing PDF attachment triggers warning, not crash
- [ ] Unmatched business name flagged in approval workflow
- [ ] Draft creation failure logged with clear error message
- [ ] System completes processing even if some PDFs fail

**Documentation:**
- [ ] User can complete setup following documentation alone
- [ ] User can run monthly workflow without external help
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide addresses observed errors during testing

## Migration Strategy from Relevance AI

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Workflow:**
1. Looker Studio â†’ Email â†’ Make.com â†’ Google Drive â†’ Relevance AI â†’ Gmail drafts

**Pain Points:**
- Relevance AI subscription cost
- Manual PDF attachment required
- No Google Analytics integration for AI insights
- Limited customization flexibility

**What's Working:**
- Make.com reliably extracts PDFs to Google Drive
- Looker Studio PDFs arrive consistently each month
- Gmail drafts approach provides review before sending

### Migration Approach

**Phase 1: Parallel Operation (Recommended)**
- Run new system alongside Relevance AI for one monthly cycle
- Compare outputs (email quality, data accuracy, time efficiency)
- User comfort level with new workflow
- Fallback to Relevance AI if critical issues arise

**Phase 2: Full Cutover**
- Disable Relevance AI workflow
- Use new system exclusively
- Monitor first two production cycles closely
- Maintain Relevance AI account (paused) for 90 days as emergency backup

**Phase 3: Full Deprecation**
- Cancel Relevance AI subscription after 90-day successful operation
- Archive Relevance AI configurations and documentation
- Fully commit to new system

### Migration Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| New system fails to extract KPIs correctly | High (clients receive incorrect data) | Medium | Parallel operation for first cycle, manual verification |
| User unfamiliar with new workflow | Medium (delayed reporting) | Low | Clear documentation, training session |
| Looker Studio changes PDF format | High (system breaks) | Low | PDF parsing fallback, alert user to format changes |
| Gmail API quota exceeded | Medium (drafts not created) | Very Low | Monitor quota usage, well within limits for 30 emails |
| Cost higher than expected | Low (budget overrun) | Low | Free/open-source focus, approve all paid tools in advance |

### Rollback Plan

**If critical issues arise:**
1. Re-enable Relevance AI workflow (Make.com â†’ Relevance AI â†’ Gmail)
2. Manually process month's reports using old system
3. Investigate and fix new system issues without time pressure
4. Re-attempt migration following month

**Rollback Triggers:**
- > 5 emails with incorrect KPI data
- System completely fails to process PDFs
- User unable to complete workflow within reasonable timeframe (< 1 hour)
- Critical security or privacy issue discovered

- Measure: Business name extraction success, KPI table extraction accuracy, code complexity

**Required Output:** Test results showing extraction accuracy per library, code snippet examples, final recommendation

---

### 5. Approval Workflow Interface
**Question:** Email-based review with CSV tracking or web-based preview interface?

**Research Requirements:**
- **Option A: Email-Based Review**
  - Workflow:
    1. System sends all generated emails to review address (e.g., `owner@agency.com`)
    2. User opens each email in Gmail, reviews content
    3. User updates CSV or Google Sheets with approval status
       - Columns: Client Name | Business Name | Status (Approved/Needs Revision) | Notes | Extraction Errors
    4. System reads tracking file, creates drafts for "Approved" emails
  - Pros: Simple, no UI development, uses familiar tools (Gmail, Excel/Sheets)
  - Cons: Less visual, manual spreadsheet management, potential for errors in status tracking

- **Option B: Web Preview Interface**
  - Workflow:
    1. System generates preview URLs or launches local web app
    2. Web interface shows each email exactly as it will appear when sent
    3. User clicks "Approve" or "Needs Revision" for each
    4. User adds notes for revisions
    5. System tracks approvals in database/file
    6. System creates drafts for approved emails
  - Pros: Visual verification, integrated experience, better UX
  - Cons: Development time, must perfectly replicate email rendering (critical), local server or cloud hosting needed
  - Email Rendering Challenge: HTML email in web browser â‰  HTML email in email client
    - Must inline all CSS
    - Must account for email client quirks (Outlook, Gmail rendering differences)
    - May need to use iframe or email testing service API
  - Technology options:
    - Local: Flask/Django (Python) or Express (Node.js) web server
    - Cloud: Simple static site with email previews
    - Email Testing Integration: Litmus API, Email on Acid API (costs $$)

**Recommendation Criteria:**
- User preference (which workflow is more comfortable?)
- Development time vs. value
- Accuracy of email preview (can web interface truly replicate email client rendering?)
- Long-term usability (will user prefer visual interface after initial learning curve?)

**Required Output:** Mockups or wireframes for both options, detailed pros/cons, user preference survey, final recommendation

---

### 6. Technology Stack Recommendation
**Question:** Python or Node.js? Which libraries and frameworks?

**Research Requirements:**
- **Python Stack:**
  - Gmail API: `google-api-python-client`
  - PDF parsing: `pdfplumber` or `camelot-py`
  - Email templating: `Jinja2`
  - Database: `sqlite3` (stdlib), `csv` (stdlib), or `gspread` (Google Sheets)
  - Fuzzy matching: `fuzzywuzzy` or `thefuzz`
  - MIME message: `email.mime` (stdlib)
  - Environment variables: `python-dotenv`
  - Logging: `logging` (stdlib)
  - Pros: Excellent PDF libraries, strong data processing, user may be familiar
  - Cons: Windows installation sometimes complex (C dependencies)

- **Node.js Stack:**
  - Gmail API: `googleapis`
  - PDF parsing: `pdf-parse` or `pdfjs-dist`
  - Email templating: `handlebars` or `ejs`
  - Database: `better-sqlite3`, `csv-parser`, or `google-spreadsheet`
  - Fuzzy matching: `fuzzball` or `fuse.js`
  - MIME message: `nodemailer`
  - Environment variables: `dotenv`
  - Logging: `winston` or `pino`
  - Pros: Excellent async handling, good for web interfaces, npm ecosystem
  - Cons: PDF parsing libraries less mature than Python

**Recommendation Criteria:**
- PDF parsing quality (most critical component)
- User's existing technical familiarity
- Windows compatibility and ease of setup
- Library maturity and community support
- Long-term maintenance (which ecosystem is better for user self-maintenance?)

**Required Output:** Full stack recommendation with library versions, installation instructions for Windows, sample code snippets

---

### 7. OAuth Setup & Credential Management
**Question:** How should OAuth credentials and tokens be securely stored and managed?

**Research Requirements:**
- Gmail API OAuth 2.0 flow:
  1. Create project in Google Cloud Console
  2. Enable Gmail API
  3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)
  4. Download `credentials.json`
  5. Run authorization flow (opens browser, user grants permissions)
  6. Receive `token.json` (contains access token + refresh token)
  7. Store `token.json` securely
  8. System uses refresh token to get new access tokens (expire every hour)

- Required Gmail API Scopes:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` or `gmail.modify` (read emails, extract PDFs)
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose` (create drafts)
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` (Phase 2: auto-send)

- Security Best Practices:
  - Store `credentials.json` and `token.json` in `.env` file or secure directory
  - Add to `.gitignore` (never commit to version control)
  - Use environment variables for sensitive paths
  - Encrypt tokens at rest (optional, OS-level encryption)
  - Implement token rotation (refresh tokens can be revoked)

- Credential Management Options:
  - **Option A:** Store as files (`credentials.json`, `token.json`) in project directory
  - **Option B:** Store in `.env` file as environment variables (serialized JSON)
  - **Option C:** Use OS keyring/credential manager (Windows Credential Manager)

**Required Output:** Step-by-step OAuth setup guide, credential storage recommendation, security checklist

## Phase 2 Features (Future Enhancements)

### Google Analytics MCP Integration

**Objective:** Direct connection to Google Analytics for real-time data access, enabling AI-generated insights.

**Capabilities:**
- Query Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for current month data (in-progress month insights)
- Compare current metrics to historical trends
- Access granular data (page-level, source/medium, user demographics)
- Enable Claude Code (via MCP) to analyze trends and generate insights

**Technical Requirements:**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Google Analytics
- GA4 API credentials (separate from Gmail API)
- OAuth scopes for read-only GA4 access
- Data caching to minimize API calls

**Use Cases:**
- "Sessions are up 25% compared to last month's average"
- "Top performing page this month: /services/seo (30% of conversions)"
- "Traffic from organic search increased 15% week-over-week"

**Implementation Timeline:** Post-MVP, dependent on Phase 1 success

---

### AI-Generated Insights

**Objective:** Claude-powered analysis of client data, generating positive, actionable insights for each email.

**Insight Categories:**
1. **Trend Identification:**
   - "Your engagement rate has increased steadily over the past 3 months"
   - "Bounce rate improved by 12% compared to the previous quarter"

2. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - "Conversions spiked 40% in the third weekâ€”this coincides with your new landing page launch"
   - "Sessions dipped on weekends, suggesting opportunity for weekend-specific campaigns"

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - "Your average session duration (3m 45s) exceeds industry average (2m 30s)"
   - "Engagement rate is 20% higher than your own 6-month average"

4. **Recommendations:**
   - "With bounce rate declining, consider expanding content on your top-performing pages"
   - "Mobile traffic now represents 60% of sessionsâ€”prioritize mobile UX improvements"

**AI Prompt Strategy:**
- Provide Claude with: client's current month data, previous 3-6 months data, industry benchmarks (if available)
- Instruction: "Identify 2-3 positive, actionable insights. Focus on trends, improvements, or opportunities. Avoid generic statements."
- Tone: Professional, optimistic, consultative
- Length: 2-4 sentences per insight

**Integration into Email:**
- Insert AI insights after predefined personalized text, before KPI table
- Section header: "Key Insights This Month"
- Clearly distinguish AI insights from human-written custom text

**Technical Requirements:**
- Claude API access (Anthropic API key)
- Prompt template system
- Data formatting for Claude (JSON or structured text)
- Insight validation (ensure positive tone, avoid hallucinations)

**Implementation Timeline:** Post-MVP, after Google Analytics MCP integration

---

### Interactive Approval Dashboard

**Objective:** Replace CSV spreadsheet with web-based dashboard for reviewing and approving emails.

**Features:**
- Email preview showing exact rendering (HTML email in iframe or email testing service)
- Side-by-side comparison: generated email vs. previous month's email (for consistency check)
- Approve/Reject buttons with one-click action
- Notes field for revision comments
- Bulk actions: "Approve All," "Approve All SEO," etc.
- Filtering: Show only "Needs Review," "Approved," "Rejected"
- Summary statistics: "25 approved, 3 need revision, 2 pending"

**User Experience:**
1. User opens dashboard URL (local: `http://localhost:5000` or cloud-hosted)
2. Dashboard displays all 30 generated emails in list view
3. User clicks on email to expand preview
4. User reviews content, clicks "Approve" or "Needs Revision"
5. For revisions, user adds note explaining issue
6. User completes review, clicks "Create Drafts" button
7. System generates Gmail drafts for all approved emails

**Technical Requirements:**
- Web framework: Flask/Django (Python) or Express (Node.js)
- Frontend: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React for richer UI)
- Email rendering: iframe with inline CSS or email testing API
- Database: Track approval status per email
- Authentication: Basic password protection (single user)

**Implementation Timeline:** Post-MVP, based on user feedback after using CSV workflow

---

### Auto-Send with Spacing

**Objective:** Programmatically send approved emails with configurable delays to avoid spam flags.

**Features:**
- User sets sending schedule: "Send 10 emails/hour" or "Space sends 5 minutes apart"
- User initiates auto-send (button or command)
- System sends emails in batches with delays
- Real-time progress tracking: "Sent 15/30 emails, next batch in 10 minutes"
- Pause/resume capability
- Error handling: If send fails, retry or skip and notify user

**Sending Strategy:**
- Delay between sends: Configurable (default: 5-10 minutes)
- Batch size: Configurable (default: 10 emails per batch, 15-minute break between batches)
- Sending hours: Configurable (default: 9 AM - 5 PM local time)
- Retry logic: If send fails, retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff

**Technical Requirements:**
- Gmail API scope: `gmail.send` (move from drafts to sent programmatically)
- Job scheduler: Python `schedule` library or Node.js `node-cron`
- Queue system: Track pending sends, mark complete
- Logging: Detailed send logs (timestamp, recipient, success/failure)

**Safety Features:**
- Confirmation prompt before auto-send: "About to send 30 emails. Proceed?"
- Daily send limit: Max 50 emails/day (safety cap)
- Manual override: User can cancel auto-send mid-process

**Implementation Timeline:** Post-MVP, after user comfort with manual sending workflow

## Project Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Technical Constraints:**
1. **Platform:** Windows environment (`c:\Users\cscot\Documents\Apps\Email Reports`)
2. **Email Provider:** Google Workspace (Gmail API required)
3. **Data Source:** Looker Studio PDFs (format controlled by Google, subject to change)
4. **Processing Model:** Monthly batch (not real-time streaming)
5. **User Access:** Single user (agency owner), no multi-user collaboration required
6. **Internet Dependency:** Gmail API requires internet connection
7. **API Quotas:** Gmail API quotas (250 units/user/second for drafts, 250 units/user/day for send)

**Business Constraints:**
1. **Budget:** Free/open-source preferred, small paid tools acceptable if justified
2. **Timeline:** Flexible, no hard deadline (quality over speed)
3. **Maintenance:** User self-maintains (no ongoing developer support)
4. **Client Count:** 30 clients (MVP), potential growth to 50-100 (future)
5. **Service Types:** SEO and Google Ads (two report types)
6. **Approval Requirement:** All emails must be reviewed before sending (at least in MVP)

**Data Constraints:**
1. **Client Database Size:** 30 records (small dataset)
2. **PDF Size:** Typically < 5MB per report (Gmail attachment limit: 25MB)
3. **KPI Count:** Six fixed metrics (may expand in future)
4. **Email Length:** HTML email ~500-800 words, KPI table, PDF attachment
5. **Personalization Data:** First name, business name, 1-2 lines custom text per client

### Assumptions

**About the Data:**
1. Looker Studio PDFs arrive reliably at start of each month
2. PDF format is consistent across months (text extractable, not image-based)
3. Business names in PDFs match client database with minor variations (fuzzy matching handles typos)
4. KPI table structure is consistent between SEO and Google Ads reports (or has identifiable variants)
5. All PDFs contain complete data (all six KPIs present)

**About the User:**
1. User has Google Workspace admin access (can create OAuth credentials)
2. User comfortable with basic technical setup (installing software, editing .env files)
3. User prefers control over full automation (approval workflow acceptable)
4. User has Windows machine available for running system (if local deployment chosen)
5. User can dedicate 30-60 minutes per month for approval workflow

**About the Workflow:**
1. Monthly reporting cadence is fixed (won't change to weekly or daily)
2. Client database changes infrequently (1-2 updates per month)
3. Email template changes infrequently (quarterly at most)
4. Sending all 30 emails over 2-3 hours is acceptable (not all within 5 minutes)
5. User reviews emails on desktop (not mobile)

**About the Technology:**
1. Gmail API will remain stable (Google's long-term support)
2. PDF parsing libraries can handle Looker Studio format (confirmed through testing)
3. HTML email rendering is consistent enough across email clients (with proper coding)
4. OAuth tokens can be refreshed automatically (no manual re-authorization monthly)
5. Local file system (Windows) is reliable for temporary PDF storage

**About Future Phases:**
1. Google Analytics MCP will be available and functional (in development by Anthropic/community)
2. User will want AI insights after seeing value in Phase 1
3. Interactive dashboard will be valued over CSV workflow (based on user feedback)
4. Auto-send will be safe and reliable (after successful manual sending period)

---

## Success Definition & Launch Criteria

### MVP Success Definition

**The MVP is considered successful if:**

1. **Data Accuracy:** 100% of emails contain correct KPI data, client personalization, and PDF attachments (zero errors across 30 emails for 2 consecutive months)

2. **Time Efficiency:** Complete workflow (PDF extraction â†’ approval â†’ draft creation) takes < 30 minutes (90%+ reduction from current Relevance AI workflow)

3. **Cost Reduction:** Operational costs reduced by 75%+ compared to Relevance AI subscription

4. **User Adoption:** User operates system independently without external support (zero support requests after first production month)

5. **Email Quality:** Clients receive professional, correctly-formatted emails that render properly in all major email clients

6. **Reliability:** System successfully processes all 30 PDFs for 3 consecutive months without critical failures
